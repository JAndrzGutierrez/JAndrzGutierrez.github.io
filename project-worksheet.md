## Project Description

My portfolio website is going to be very simple but functional because right now I'm trying to master my foundation skills before I try to use more complex technology. I will be using the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery that I've learned the last 2 weeks of coding camp.


## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP (examples)

- Html, Css And JavaScript for the structure foundation of the site.
- I will be focusing in the mobile first design using cssgrid and flexbox.
- jQuery interactions for cursors animations and css styling.

#### PostMVP 

- Cursor Hover Animation
- Social Media Icons

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into smaller components.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the portfolio. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the portfolio must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | 
| Basic Html   | H | 1hr | 2hr |
| css grid and styling| H | 3hr | 3hr |
| Regular Nav | H | 1hr | 1hr |  
| Adding contact Form | H | 1.5hr|  3hr | 
|jquery animations and styling | M | 3hr | 3hr|
| Responsive | H | 3hr | hr | 3hr |

| Total | H | 15.5hrs| hrs | 12hrs

#### PostMVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | 
| cursorHover animation| L | 3hr | -hr | 3hr |
| Social Media Icons | L | 1hr |  2hr |
| Total | H | 20hrs| 5hrs more less|
